## About
Simple [uMap](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/) replacement with an enhanced
search and filter capability. Custom-tailored.

![Screenshot](/map/app-map/src/assets/screenshot.png)

Import location and street address information by uploading an OpenDocument
spreadsheet (ods-table) into a WordPress-PostgreSQL database and display its
content on an OpenStreetMap layer.

To respect data privacy, providing street address information is optional. In
such a case a corresponding map-marker is placed on a nearby public place (park,
lake, etc.)

See the ods-table format
[description](/map/app-form/src/app/services/ods-table/ods.ts).

User authentication for the ods-table file upload is provided by a WordPress
installation using the [JWT Authentication for WP REST
API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jwt-authentication-for-wp-rest-api/) plugin.

# cmap

Start a [REPL](#repls) in your editor or terminal of choice.

Start the server with:

```clojure
(go)
```

The default API is available under http://localhost:3000/api

System configuration is available under `resources/system.edn`.

To reload changes:

```clojure
(reset)
```

Result of the main query `read-associations` is available under
http://localhost:3000/api/db-vals (need to call `(reset)` when changed)


## Build & Deploy

```shell
# build the app
clj -Sforce -T:build all

# transfer to Test / Prod system
remoteShell="ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -p ..." # define port number
rsync -av --rsh="$remoteShell" /path/to/cmap-standalone.jar <USER>@<HOST>:<HOST_HOME>/path/to/cmap-standalone.jar

# on the Test / Prod system, define environment variables in the $HOME/.profile
export CMAP_PORT=8002
export CMAP_MYSQL_PASSWORD=
# See https://www.urlencoder.io/ for special chars (=,?,& etc) in the URL
export CMAP_MYSQL_PASSWORD_ESCAPED=
export CMAP_MYSQL_USER=
export CMAP_MYSQL_HOST=...
export CMAP_MYSQL_PORT=... # typically 3306
export CMAP_JDBC_URL="mysql://$CMAP_MYSQL_HOST:$CMAP_MYSQL_PORT/associations?user=$CMAP_MYSQL_USER&password=$CMAP_MYSQL_PASSWORD_ESCAPED"

# launch the app from the CLI
java -jar $HOME/path/to/cmap-standalone.jar
```

## Run as a SystemD service

```shell
# On the target machine
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp etc/systemd/system/cmap-standalone.service /etc/systemd/system/cmap-standalone.service

# Enable the service to start at boot time:
sudo systemctl enable cmap-standalone

# When editing the cmap-standalone.service, reload the systemd manager
# configuration:
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

# (Re)Start the service immediately:
# sudo systemctl start cmap-standalone
sudo systemctl restart cmap-standalone

# Check the status of your service:
sudo systemctl status cmap-standalone

# Inspect / view the log file:
sudo journalctl -u cmap-standalone -f
```

## REPLs

```shell
# npm install
npx shadow-cljs watch app
```

### Cursive

Configure a [REPL following the Cursive
documentation](https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/repl.html). Using the default
"Run with IntelliJ project classpath" option will let you select an alias from
the ["Clojure deps" aliases
selection](https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/deps.html#refreshing-deps-dependencies).

### CIDER

Use the `cider` alias for CIDER nREPL support (run `clj -M:dev:cider`). See the
[CIDER docs](https://docs.cider.mx/cider/basics/up_and_running.html) for more
help.

Note that this alias runs nREPL during development. To run nREPL in production
(typically when the system starts), use the kit-nrepl library through the +nrepl
profile as described in [the
documentation](https://kit-clj.github.io/docs/profiles.html#profiles).

### Command Line

Run `clj -M:dev:nrepl` or `make repl`.

Note that, just like with [CIDER](#cider), this alias runs nREPL during
development. To run nREPL in production (typically when the system starts), use
the kit-nrepl library through the +nrepl profile as described in [the
documentation](https://kit-clj.github.io/docs/profiles.html#profiles).


## Database

Export:
```
mysqldump -u $USER -p associations > map/database/db-export/associations.sql
```
