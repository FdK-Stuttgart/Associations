Import location and street address information by uploading an OpenDocument
spreadsheet (ods-table) into a WordPress-PostgreSQL database and display its
content on an OpenStreetMap layer.

See the ods-table format
[description](/map/app-form/src/app/services/ods-table/ods.ts).

User authentication for the ods-table file upload is provided by a WordPress
installation using the [JWT Authentication for WP REST
API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/jwt-authentication-for-wp-rest-api/) plugin.
